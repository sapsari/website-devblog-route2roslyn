Hey, 

I'm Yellow, I develop tools and games. In this blog, I'll mostly write about C# and Roslyn. I'll try to write about topics that has no clear documentation or has not been discussed in stackoverflow or any other blog.

<!-- end -->

Tools that I have been developing:

* [Pattern Maker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MerryYellow.patternmaker)
* [Code Enchanter](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/code-enchanter-120279)

Games that I worked on:

* [Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord](https://www.taleworlds.com/en/Games/Bannerlord)
* [Mount & Blade: Warband](https://www.taleworlds.com/en/Games/Warband)

I don't use social media very often, but you can always contact me via [email](mailto:merryyellow@outlook.com).
